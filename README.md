# ðŸŽ¤ Text to Speech Application

This is a simple **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** web application that converts text from user input or uploaded documents (PDF or DOCX) into speech. The application automatically detects the language of the text and uses **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)** to generate speech audio.

## Features

- **Upload PDF or DOCX Files**: Extracts text from uploaded files and converts it to speech.
- **Text Area Input**: Converts text entered by the user into speech.
- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects the language of the input text or uploaded file before converting it to speech.
- **Audio Playback**: After generating speech, the app allows users to play the audio directly within the interface.
